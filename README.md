# Svelte Common Recommendations (SCR)

Svelte Common Recommendations is a set of publications tackling common problems in svelte, offering solutions that otherwise would be too short to be published as libraries on their own.


> **Note**
> All publications are meant for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), not for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).


All proposals are welcome, we have a [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
