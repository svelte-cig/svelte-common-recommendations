# Svelte Common Recommendations (SCR)

Svelte Common Recommendations is a set of publications tackling common problems in svelte, offering solutions that otherwise would be too short to be published as libraries on their own.

Publications you'll find in this repository are of different types

- **Design patterns**\
    A [design pattern](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) is an opinionated template of a solution.\
    A pattern will not provide concrete implementation of a solution.\
    Generally speaking patterns will be more verbose and more abstract, explaining in detail the reasons fore some choices over others.
- **Recommendations**\
    A recommendation is an implementation of a short solution to a problem.\
- **Library Recommendations**\
    A list of recommended libraries that solve specific problems.\

> **Note**\
> Some problems may be showcased as both design patterns and recommendations.


> **Note**
> All publications are meant for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), not for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).


All proposals are welcome, we have a [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
